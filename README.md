# green-alert
A key challenge Kilimani faces is urban pressure resulting from uncontrolled development, which leads to poor zoning enforcement and livability issues. This has resulted in a reduction of green spaces, thus less sustainable living. 
We intend to map out the ratio of built area footprint to green area in the Kilimani ward. We will then propose a prototype has an alert system with thresholds. An example is having red, yellow, and green zones as thresholds, each with a ratio of built to green area. For each zone, we intend to propose the type of developments that could be done in such areas. For red zones, that is, those with an imbalanced ratio, we will propose design interventions that match that area to increase sustainability eg.use the remaining area in such blocks for recreation and demountable facilities for such plots.
